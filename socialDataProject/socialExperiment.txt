NAICS code
Questions on aggregation: the .txt file contains only 2MM records - less than the number of outstanding physical locations of companies in 2013. Is the data aggregated? The field description file contains a field "Total Number of Establishments" - this could be a count field - counting the number of locations of that NAICS code in the county - or can merely be the number of establishments owned and operated by the same company.
Definition of establishment per the Census Bureau: An establishment is a single physical location at which business is conducted or services or industrial operations are performed. It is not necessarily identical with a company or enterprise, which may consist of one or more establishments. When two or more activities are carried on at a single location under a single ownership, all activities generally are grouped together as a single establishment. The entire establishment is classified on the basis of its major activity and all data are included in that classification.

Establishment counts represent the number of locations with paid employees any time during the year. This series excludes government establishments except for wholesale liquor establishments (NAICS 4248), retail liquor stores (NAICS 44531), Federally-chartered savings institutions (NAICS 522120), Federally-chartered credit unions (NAICS 522130), and hospitals (NAICS 622).

cancer mortality or incidence rate by county: 
- look at "cancer profiles" and "cancer data providers": http://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/resources/* - provides interactive map
National Cancer Institute - table generator for counties: http://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/incidencerates/index.php

Incidence information
- read about methodologies and data sources used by statecancerprofiles and the CDC and US Cancer statistics: 
a) http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/uscs/technical_notes/data_sources/incidence.htm
b) http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/uscs/technical_notes/interpreting/incidence.htm
c) http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/uscs/technical_notes/stat_methods/rates.htm
- SEER also has incidence information by county but only for a few counties... the majority are left out; I may wish to contact SEER
Incidence rates are provided for states with cancer registries whose data have met the criteria required for inclusion in the US Cancer Statistics (http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/uscs/).

Population of a county:

Proportion of elderly:

Proportion insured/uninsured||unemployment rate||median income

Weaknesses: workers travel to work; people engage in different dietary habits.

Introduction of pollutants is typically from air, water and food. Water is filtered, but harsh metals cannot be filtered. Industries can emit to water streams that move emissions to other areas of the country.
